A d20/3.5/PF js-based Character Sheet Generator

<h2>
  An HTML and Javascript-based Character sheet generator that doesn't look like crap!
</h2>



FUNCTIONING for ALL base races/classes:
- Race Select
- Class Select
- Roll and Assign Ability Scores
	- Error Handling
- Calculate Ability Modifiers (with racial bonuses)
- Display Class/Cross-class skills (based on class)
- Calculate Skill points starting (based on race, class, ability score/modifiers)
- Allocate skill points
- Calculate Total Skill Ranks (based on class/cross-class, racial bonuses and ability modifier)


IN PROGRESS
- Character Sheet Render
- Feats handling. Some work. No game rule information written.


TO DO
- Add data input for roll playing text (large text areas)
- Render all data on character sheet
- Handle additional game rule information (languages, conditional bonuses, etc.)
- Handle all magic and spells. What a nightmare. 
- Equipment. Ugh. 
- Allow leveled input. Kill me now. 
- Carrying capacity. fml. 
- Oh, yeah, and figure out a way to make this sheet NOT completely useless when going to print it. 
	- Either:
		- Fine tune styling so a printed html document doesn't look like crap.
		- Figure out a way to have this information fill out a PDF form. sigh. 
		- Get this thing to spit out an image file (.png, .jpg, etc.) so at least users can have a chance at a print that doesnt resemble dog poo.
- Publish
- Profit?
